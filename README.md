üí° RGB LED Control Project

> **About this project:**  
> This project demonstrates controlling an RGB LED with Arduino using PWM (`analogWrite()`).  
> For the physical setup, we used inverted PWM values in code.  
> It has been **simulated in TinkerCAD**, **designed in Fritzing**, and **tested in a physical environment**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice: Common Cathode vs. Common Anode

> **Heads-up!**  
> RGB LEDs come in two types: **Common Cathode** and **Common Anode**.  
> - In **Common Cathode**, the common pin is connected to **GND**.    
> - In **Common Anode**, the common pin is connected to **+5V**.  

We provide **two versions of the code**:  
- **Common Cathode version** (used in TinkerCAD and Fritzing simulation)  
- **Common Anode version** (used in our physical circuit)

You can find them in the project folders:  
- [common_cathode/common_cathode.ino](common_cathode/common_cathode.ino)  
- [common_anode/common_anode.ino](common_anode/common_anode.ino)
